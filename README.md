# DRY-WET-WASTE-SEGREGATOR-
A dry and wet waste segregator is a device or system designed to automatically separate dry waste (such as paper, plastic, and metals) from wet waste (such as food scraps, vegetable peels, and other organic materials). This segregation is crucial for efficient waste management, recycling, and composting processes.
